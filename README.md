# ü•Ä How it works
```sh-session
‚úî Boost Simulation Algorithm:DiscordBoostMaster uses a sophisticated simulation algorithm to replicate user interactions with the Discord API. While it appears that boosts are being performed without cost, this is purely fictional and does not impact the actual server boosting status.

‚úî API Interaction Emulation:The tool emulates API requests to closely resemble genuine interactions with the Discord server. It crafts these requests to give the illusion of boosting while maintaining the appearance of an untouched boost count.

‚úî Session Manipulation: To keep the illusion of unused boosts, DiscordBoostMaster manipulates session data, creating a temporary environment where the Discord API perceives the boosts as unused.
